## 👩‍💻 About the project

The project is a REST Application for t-shirt sales, made with NextJS and integrated with STRIPE for payments, also contains a 2s delay so that you can view the skeleton screen.

 As per [STRIPE](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) documentation, to simulate a purchase, you can use the number: 4242424242424242 for the card, any future date, and any CVC/e-mail/name.
 
 Built during [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) ReactJS course, where I was able to deepen my knowledge of this front-end library
