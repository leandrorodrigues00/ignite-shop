## 👩‍💻 About the project

This project, built with NextJS, offers a seamless online shopping experience for t-shirts. It utilizes the powerful payment processing capabilities of [STRIPE](https://stripe.com/), ensuring secure and convenient transactions for customers. Also contains a 2s delay so that you can view the skeleton screen.

To facilitate testing and demonstrate the payment functionality, the [STRIPE](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) documentation suggests using the following details: Card Number: 4242424242424242, any future date for expiration, and any CVC, email, or name.
